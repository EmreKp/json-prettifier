# json-prettifier
A JSON prettifier written using Swing framework

This project is draft right now, but it will be improved on later times by adding new features. If you have suggestions, please open issue or make pull requests. My main goal to make the application is to learn and have ideas about GUI frameworks especially Swing or Qt or any framework else.

### Running
To run program directly, in Linux and Mac OS (Windows executable will be added too), just open your Terminal and type:
```
sh json-prettifier.sh
```

### Building from source
(will be added)
